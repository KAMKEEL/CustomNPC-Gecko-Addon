CustomNPC+ is distributed under a reasonably open license. You probably want to have a read through this if you want to do something with it other than just play.

You are completely free and have the right to Use, Share and Adapt the mod. These rights can not be removed from you as long as follow the license terms.
If you simply wish to play with the mod and do nothing else, go for it, this license is of no use to you.

TL;DR
> You CAN
-- Fork and modify the code.
-- Submit Pull Requests to this repository.
-- Copy portions of this code for use in other projects.
-- Write your own code that uses this code as a dependency. (addon mods!)

> You CANNOT
-- Redistribute this in its entirety as source or compiled code.
-- Create or distribute code which contains 50% or more Functionally Equivalent Statements* from this repository.

> You MUST
-- Maintain a visible repository of your code which is inspired by, derived from, or copied from this code. Basically, if you use it, pay it forward. You keep rights to your OWN code, but you still must make your source visible.

General Clauses
Clauses that apply in general to any of the uses that follow.
- Personal Permission Clause
  I will only give personal permission if I, KAMKEEL, am directly asked. If personal permission is given this does not imply endorsement.
- Waive Clause
  All restrictive clauses in this license can be ignored with personal permission. Read the above clause.
- Extensive Clause
  This license applies to CustomNPC+, the CustomNPC+ website, the legacy CustomNPC+ website and all other code, assets or binaries found on this website or the github repository unless otherwise indicated.
- Informal Clause
  This license will not hold up in court. I have no intention of suing anyone for breaking it, the worst that can happen to you if you do is that I'll get annoyed and ask you to rectify your mistake. If you use a public distribution platform (such as CurseForge) it's also possible your project will get taken down. Breaking the license also makes you a jerk, and you don't want to be a jerk, do you?

If you want to Distribute CustomNPC+
"Distribution" refers to making available binaries, assets, or source of the mod available from the original sources as part of your modpack or otherwise.
- Attribution Clause
  You must give appropriate credit to KAMKEEL as the creator of CustomNPC+ or the parts of it you're using. Noppes can also be credit as the original Mod Author. If you do any alterations the fact that you do so should also be indicated. A link back is optional but it would be cool if you would do so.
- Redistribution Clause
  You may not redistribute the enitirity of the source code provided, unless heavy modifications are made to it as a whole. More than 50% of the code cannot be redistributed unless direct permission is provided from either KAMKEEL or Noppes.
- Non-Monetary Clause
  You may not charge for access to the distribution itself or gain money through it, this includes any type of inline advertisement, such as url shorteners (adf.ly or otherwise) or ads in your service slowing the download down. This includes restricting any amount of access behind a paywall. Charging for ingame goods such as mod items or cosmetic features on a server does not count as distribution and falls purely under the Mojang Terms of Service.

If you want to Feature CustomNPC+
"Featuring" refers to using CustomNPC+ in an environment where you do not distribute binaries, assets, or source. An example would be a YouTube Let's Play.
- Thief Clause
  You must not claim that you made CustomNPC+. Giving appropriate credit to KAMKEEL as the creator of CustomNPC+ makes you cooler, but you don't have to do it if you don't want to.

If you want to Use CustomNPC+ Code or Assets
Usage of code or assets falls under the Extensive Clause.
- External Clause
  Certain parts of the codebase are indicated to be licensed under alternative licenses. You must obey those licenses.
- Attribution Clause
  You must give appropriate credit to KAMKEEL as the creator of CustomNPC+ or the parts of it you're using. Noppes can also be credit as the original Mod Author. If you do any alterations the fact that you do so should also be indicated. A link back is optional but it would be cool if you would do so.
- Copyleft Clause
  Your project must be open source (have its source visible and allow for redistribution and modification) and include a clause similar to this one in its license.
- API Clause
  Any of the other clauses under this section do not apply to any CustomNPC+ API code (the subdirectory src/api or https://github.com/KAMKEEL/CustomNPC-Plus-API). However, if CustomNPC+ API code is used, it must be included verbatim as it was obtained.
